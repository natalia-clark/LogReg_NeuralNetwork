# Logistic Regression implemented with a Neural Network
Quick example of logistic regression using a basic neural network.

## Goal:
- Understand that basic logistic regression of 2 linearly separable classes can be done with a small neural network
- solidify the understandings of the math behind logistic regression and how it is duplicable by a neural network

## Note from professor:
The most important part of this notebook is to identify the ingredientes of logistic regression as well as to understand the mechanism logistic regression is using to classify the points.

Note: For the code above the optional exercise, the fundamentals are done and provided by Professor Ruben Zazo Candil at IE University in Madrid. All changes below the assignment were completed by me with his code as a guide as part of an optional assignment to understand basic neural networks.
